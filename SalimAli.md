# Transcript of Radio Autobiography of Dr. Salim Ali - "The Birdman of India"

## Early Beginnings

**Interviewer:** Dr. Salim Ali, how did it all begin? What's behind this lifetime obsession you have with birds?

**Dr. Ali:** I can't pinpoint exactly what started the interest, but I know that when we were small, about seven or eight years old, we used to live in Khetwadi in a large family. Now and again we used to have a good many partridges and quails for eating because in those days you could buy them freely in the market. The man used to bring them to our house in round baskets covered with burlap. Before they were slaughtered, there was a nephew of mine who was about my own age. We had formed a partnership in pet keeping, and we used to secretly pinch some of the partridges and quails and keep them as pets in a specially constructed pen of wire netting and packing cases. We used to sit and watch their behavior and habits and feeding. This is how the interest grew.

When we were rather more flush with money after a birthday party or something, we used to go to the Crawford Market and buy some better birds—maybe spur fowl or jungle fowl. That is how we built up a little collection there, and we used to sit and watch and enjoy the fun.

**Interviewer:** This was when you were around seven years of age?

**Dr. Ali:** Seven or eight.

**Interviewer:** But as a boy of seven or eight, this interest that germinated with the acquisition of spur fowl and partridges—how did this further develop into the actual study that has now channeled your life?

**Dr. Ali:** At the same time I had an air gun, and like all naughty boys I used to shoot quite a lot of sparrows around our house in Bombay. In our school holidays we used to go to Chembur, which was really quite a jungle and very difficult to reach because there were no communications then. You had to go either by horse carriage or by bullock cart.

To get our supply of milk and eggs, we small boys had to go to a village called Deonar and go from hut to hut and collect the eggs that their chickens had laid. At the same time, in that village there were lots of hay stacks put up on trees after the rice harvest to prevent the cattle from eating it. In those stacks, a lot of sparrows used to come and roost at night. So I waited there with the air gun, and as they came along, we shot them.

Most of them were house sparrows, but one sparrow I shot looked rather different. It was certainly not the house sparrow, and I didn't know what it was. We used to clean them, roast them, and eat them. But this one was a different bird. As you know, among Muslims there are certain birds that are halal to be eaten and certain not to be—if you eat those you go straight to hell. So we were taught not to eat those forbidden birds.

I didn't slaughter that sparrow. I took it home to show it to my uncle to find out whether it was lawful meat or not. He looked at it and said, "This is certainly different from the house sparrow, but I can't tell you." But he was one of the founder members of the Bombay Natural History Society, so he gave me a letter to the secretary and said, "You go to him and he will help you identify this bird."

## Meeting W.S. Millard

So I took the sparrow and the letter to the Society. It was a long journey from Chembur to Bombay. I was very frightened of the Englishmen at that time because we had heard such stories about their behavior with Indians. I was very diffident to face a full-grown Englishman, but then I timidly went up the stairs, through that tangle of skins lying on the ground and tigers' heads on the walls, and got to the secretary's office.

I presented myself to the secretary, Mr. Millard, who was one of the earliest secretaries. I gave him the letter. He was so surprised that a small Indian boy should be so interested as to want to know what sparrow this is, because his experience was that there were very few grown-up Indians who were at all interested in these things. When a small boy came in, he was very astonished.

He took a great deal of trouble over the sparrow. He took me around the Society's rooms and collections, opened up cabinet after cabinet, and got the sparrow—which was a yellow-throated sparrow. He showed me these skins in the collection and compared it with the bird I had brought. I found that it was the same bird.

He said, "If you have an air gun, why don't you shoot other birds of different kinds and bring them here? I will identify them for you and I will have you trained how to skin the bird and preserve it and put the proper labels on. You can make a small collection, and I will give you whatever books there are about them."

I was very delighted, and I never knew that Englishmen could be human!

**Interviewer:** So it was Millard's initial encouragement?

**Dr. Ali:** Yes, I think initially that started it off. In those days there were no illustrated bird books—just writing and at the most pencil line drawings, which really don't mean very much to a beginner unless you can see a colored illustration. You'd have to have more than usual interest to read through all that.

He gave me what books they had and asked me to come again and take some more. That is how I got encouraged. I made a small collection, and from that time I have been very closely connected with the Society.

## Early Ambitions and Family Support

**Interviewer:** That was when you were a very small boy. There must have been other ambitions, other plans and dreams you had. Most young people seem to want to know...

**Dr. Ali:** At that time hunting was all the fashion. Every young man of any importance hunted, and that was the great thing. So it was my ambition to become a big game hunter when I grew up—a zoologist and a big game hunter.

**Interviewer:** Remarkable. Did your family share your enthusiasm from the very beginning?

**Dr. Ali:** In the beginning there was great encouragement, but when it developed into something more serious and they felt that I was neglecting my school lessons and going in for bird chasing and bird watching and collecting eggs, then they were not at all amused. It was only my brother—one of my elder brothers who was in the ICS—who encouraged me. He said, "This is a very good thing, you go on with this. Don't neglect your studies, but you keep on." He got for me all the skinning equipment and whatever I needed for the work, unbeknown to the rest of the family.

**Interviewer:** There seems to be a very definite connection between what you say now and what we know about Darwin. I understand that when Darwin was a little boy he was severely reprimanded by his family for similar interests.

**Dr. Ali:** I think that's a human characteristic, especially with your parents concerned about your education.

## Education

**Interviewer:** What was it that you were studying at around the time you were to go to college?

**Dr. Ali:** I started off in a girls' school known by the wonderful name of Zanana Bible Medical Mission Girls' School. Later on they changed the name to Queen Mary's High School for Girls. I went there with two of my sisters. At that time I was about six, and that school was meant only for girls. So when I grew up to about eight, I ceased to be a girl and I was taken off and sent to St. Xavier's.

After I finished my matriculation, I went to college with the idea of taking up zoology. But at that time there was no BSc—there was BA Honours, and you could take zoology. To get to the zoology stage, which is two years later after the first year, you had to do mathematics, algebra, logarithms—which I couldn't manage at all. I was simply sick of college and said, "Well, if this is the only way in which you can get to the zoology course, then I'd better give up zoology and take to something else because I can't manage this."

## Burma Years

Just at that time, one of my elder brothers who was in Burma doing wolfram mining wrote to my uncle. He said, "I am very short-handed here. If Salim is not very keen on continuing his studies, I would like to have him here because he will be a great help."

I jumped at the idea to get away from mathematics, and I went to Burma. I was helping him with the mining, and we had some other business of machinery and mining tools. But it gave me a lot of opportunities for going about in the jungles, and that is really where my serious bird study started.

**Interviewer:** That was also a time when the world was going through quite a lot of turmoil. Your passage from India to Burma was not without incident?

**Dr. Ali:** Yes, that was the time of the First World War. Wolfram is a mineral you get tungsten from for making high-speed steel for guns, which was in great demand because the First World War was on. To get to Rangoon you had to cross the Bay of Bengal, and at that time there was a German cruiser playing havoc. It had a very gallant captain who would take off the passengers from ships and then blow them up. There was great sympathy for the Germans at that time because of his chivalrous behavior.

That ship—you never knew where it was because those were not the days of wireless telegraphy. We had such fantastic tales of the ship bombarding Madras and then Calcutta or some other part all at the same time. So this crossing from Calcutta to Rangoon was quite exciting. You never knew what you were running into.

**Interviewer:** Then your stay in Rangoon consolidated this interest?

**Dr. Ali:** I didn't stay in Rangoon. I went from Rangoon down to Tavoy in South Burma. I was there for three years, and then I said that I had no sort of training in business—I'm just sort of pitchforked into it, I know nothing about the theory. My brother agreed that I should come to Bombay and take a course in commerce at Sydenham College.

At that same time, Father Blatter persuaded me to take up zoology because he said, "You will never get anywhere with ornithology unless you have a scientific background of zoology." So I went through the course of zoology. At that time I didn't sit for the examination because I had no idea that I would be having this as my profession later on. We were doing quite well in business in Burma, and we never bothered.

That is why I feel that every young man who aspires to a job anywhere must get a university degree. He must have these letters behind his name, otherwise he will have the same fate as myself—he will never get a job. Wherever you went they said, "Oh, you haven't got a degree, what will you be able to do?"

## Return to Bombay and Marriage

**Interviewer:** When you returned to Bombay from Burma, and when Father Blatter further directed this interest and channeled your interest from ornithology into the scientific discipline of zoology, your contact with the Bombay Natural History Society must have become more cemented?

**Dr. Ali:** Especially because the curator of the Bombay Natural History Society, Mr. Prater, who was a great friend of mine, was also being given courses by Father Blatter. So we used to go together there and attend the zoology lectures. I remember when we had to do practicals in pairs working together, and we had to dissect a cockroach, I always gave the privilege to Prater to do it!

After we finished that one year's course, I went back to Burma. But during that time I got engaged and married, and then I took my wife with me to Burma.

**Interviewer:** On your return, how did you support yourself?

**Dr. Ali:** Very doubtfully! We had a little income from investments, but it was hardly enough to settle down in Bombay. My wife got a job as secretary of the Women's Council, and I was taken on by a firm of some cousins as a sort of charitable gesture. I had had some training in commerce and business, but they didn't really want anybody. There were no prospects there, and I was all the time looking out for something in natural history or zoology in which I had my interest.

## Training in Germany

**Interviewer:** When was it that you first came into contact with Dr. Stresemann?

**Dr. Ali:** That was after I got a job as guide lecturer in natural history at the Prince of Wales Museum and Natural History Society through Father Blatter, who was also on the selection committee for this newly created post. I was a guide lecturer at the museum—I used to take out students and classes and teachers, as we are doing now, more or less.

But after two years I got fed up with this and said, "I want to get back to serious ornithology now." I tried to get some training in India. I wrote to all the universities, but there was not a single institution or university which catered for ornithology as such—only general zoology, dissection of pigeons and so on.

Then I wrote to the British Museum and to the Berlin Museum. The British Museum people were not very encouraging to an Indian due to political things. But the Berlin Museum director was Stresemann, who was a very well-known ornithologist, and he was most cordial. He said, "Yes, you come along, we will do everything possible." And that is really what they did. When I got there they went all out to give me the training that I needed. I was there for about nine months.

After that, I had taken study leave from the Natural History Society. When I got back, the first news I got was that my job had been axed because the Government of Bombay said they had financial stringency and couldn't afford it.

So I was again without a job.

**Interviewer:** You returned to India faced with the prospect of no job, with a wife to support?

**Dr. Ali:** Well, luckily the wife had a job which supported me really, more than I supported her for the time being. And this little job that I had from these cousins.

Then I tried everywhere. There was a vacancy in the Indian Museum in Calcutta of an ornithologist, so I thought this was a wonderful opportunity and I applied. But with all the recommendations of Blatter and the Society, they said, "You have no degree, so you can't."

I was very frustrated and disappointed at that time. But now I think that is the best thing that could have happened to me, because some of the contemporaries and people who got the job and so on—they have retired and they have become sort of limpets and mushrooms. I find myself still interested and going on in anything but a limpet or mushroom! So that's what I now realize—that was the most fortunate turn in my life that I didn't get that job.

## Influence of Stresemann

Stresemann had particularly stressed this point, which has been very well reviewed in many of my papers—the ecological angle given to these studies. Otherwise people used to go and collect birds and bring back hundreds of birds which were taxonomically studied and nothing more about them. But I am particularly interested in the living bird—how it lives, where it lives, why it lives there, what it eats, and the breeding biology. My reports are mostly on those lines.

They were very well reviewed in various scientific journals, saying this is a new line that has been started in India and this is what should be the model of the work.

**Interviewer:** Was there at this point internationally other precedents? Were there other countries studying bird behavior and ecology?

**Dr. Ali:** Practically nothing was done in India, but even in Western countries it had more or less just begun. They had advanced a little more than us, but still at this point—now as we see it—I came in touch with Dr. Stresemann, who changed my perspective from the taxonomy and morphology of birds more into their breeding habits, geography, geographical distribution, and all sorts of ecological aspects of bird study. I think Stresemann, up to the end, kept up with me. All my difficulties I conveyed to him, and he was very helpful right up to the end. I called him my guru.

## Field Work and Marriage

**Interviewer:** The study of bird habits and the ecology of birds necessitates a considerable amount of field travel. You were then a young man with a young wife. How did this reconciliation take place?

**Dr. Ali:** It was my great good fortune that my wife had the same tastes as I had. She had been educated all her life in England—her parents went and settled there, and from the age of five to seventeen when they came back, she had all her education in England.

When my sisters cunningly contrived that I should meet her, I was very doubtful. I said that my life will be all in the jungles, and she is a town-bred girl—how will she fit into this? Of course, she had been used to much better living than I could afford, and perhaps I thought it would not be suitable.

But when I met her and talked to her, I found that she was just—she had the same taste as I had. She was fed up with the social life in cities and said she would be very happy to be in the jungle and be spared from all these sort of activities that social ladies have to do.

That is why she stood up with all this bullock cart travel and walking for miles to the jungle. This is how we used to move about—not like nowadays where you get into a car or a jeep and you go everywhere. That gave us plenty of time to do the work thoroughly, not just go there and back again. We lived for weeks together in the jungle, sometimes in a village house, sometimes in a broken-down cattle shed. I must say I admire her for all that, and she appeared to be enjoying it. I hope she was enjoying it, but I'm certain she would have been enjoying being with me.

**Interviewer:** Would she invariably travel with you to all your field assignments?

**Dr. Ali:** Quite often, but not always. When it was very strenuous, I didn't take her along.

**Interviewer:** Was there no danger then? Surely those were days when there was not as much control in terms of law and order and policing of the interiors?

**Dr. Ali:** There was far more control than we have now. Look at this mangalsutra snatching and so on—we never used to hear anything of that type. It was really quite safe from the dacoits and these anti-social people altogether. It was much safer.

**Interviewer:** Did she also play any part in helping you with field observations?

**Dr. Ali:** Not with field observations so much, but for all my secretarial work, yes. I used to dictate, and she used to type.

## State Surveys

**Interviewer:** When you returned from Berlin in 1929 and found yourself without a job, where did your study of birds take you?

**Dr. Ali:** When I got back, the first news that I got was that my job had been axed because the Government of Bombay had no money to keep it going. I was wondering what I should do, because after having studied all the technique of taxonomy, I didn't want just to go back to selling dyes or nails or coir rope or whatever.

As there were no jobs going, I asked the Society to write to the various princely states that had been very little worked—a lot of work had to be done there. The Society wrote to the states, and the advantage then was that most of these states had British senior ICS people as administrators, and they were all members of the Society and very keen on natural history.

The Society asked them if they would provide the funds for carrying on bird surveys—I would be working without any salary, but the grant would just cover the expenses. The Society would lend me one of their taxidermists, and then I could conduct the surveys.

That is how it started. First it started with the Hyderabad State—a six-month survey was done there and the report was published. I think it had a good effect, and other states also afterward followed quite readily. Next one was Travancore, then Cochin, then I don't remember the order, but it covered the whole of Central India, Mysore, part of the Eastern Ghats, part of what is now Madhya Pradesh, Bahawalpur, Gujarat, and Kutch. So most of the areas that were blank were covered, and now we have a comprehensive account of all the ornithology of those places.

**Interviewer:** What was the composition of these surveys? What was the prime objective?

**Dr. Ali:** The thing was that just at that time, this business of trinomials—that is to say, the definition of subspecies—you know that species are also divided geographically according to some small differences, but they have to be recorded because to study evolution you have to have even minor differences on record.

Although we knew what species are likely to occur, we didn't know what subspecies was found in that area, what the differences were—for instance, in northern birds and southern birds and western birds and eastern birds. That was very necessary, and those were the collections that we made. At that time they were the basis of the determination of subspecies.

**Interviewer:** At this stage you were still talking mainly about the taxonomy and the morphology of these birds? The surveys did not take into account things like their food habits and what they would eat and how they would interact with other species?

**Dr. Ali:** Well, my particular interest was ecology. The subspecies business was an excuse, because otherwise I would never get a chance unless you brought back some specimens and let the museum people worry about them. But I myself really was much more interested in the ecology of the birds and the habitats and why they lived in particular habitats, what was the particular attraction for them—some special food, the sort of phenology where you connect up the vegetation and the flowering times and the fruiting times and the nesting times of the birds. You try to get a sort of jigsaw puzzle—you fit in all these things and you get much more fun out of that than just looking at dead skins.

**Interviewer:** During the course of these surveys, considering there was so little work done in these areas previously, would you remember any species that you might consider these surveys responsible for discovering?

**Dr. Ali:** Quite a number of subspecies were described by the man who coordinated with me by doing the taxonomical work while I did the ecological work. This was Hugh Whistler. He was a very good friend of mine and a good taxonomist. He had retired from India and settled down in England, and then he couldn't get any chances of doing field work. So he was working on the museum collections.

Again and again in the reviews of my reports, everybody was very appreciative of the fact that some sort of ecological work was done, because in the olden days they just stuffed a skin and sent it to the museum, they identified it, and more or less that was that. But nobody bothered about the living bird.

**Interviewer:** These were trying days. Traveling into the kind of places that you had gone to must have been fairly difficult. The infrastructure must have been almost non-existent?

**Dr. Ali:** Yes, there were no facilities really unless you created them yourself. We traveled by bullock carts and by foot or by camels or whatever you got.

**Interviewer:** Did many people accompany you on your field trips?

**Dr. Ali:** Usually I had only those two taxidermists from the Society and my wife Tehmina. The curious thing about it is that she took so kindly to this kind of life, although she was quite unused to it. She went with her family to England when she was five and had all her education there. The life there was entirely different to anything approaching this, and that she should have taken so well to this sort of life was a great thing. That is how I really could do something, actually.

Apart from her, we had a servant—someone who cooked and who looked after us. Such servants are not born nowadays—that's a past generation that's gone. The amount of trouble he took was really wonderful. If we got to a place at midnight, he would insist on cooking something. He said, "No, no, you can't go to sleep without eating something." He would open up all the utensils and light a fire and cook something or the other.

**Interviewer:** How many years did these state surveys go on for?

**Dr. Ali:** I started in 1930 when I came back from Germany, and then off and on—one would last for six months or so, then I would come back and write up my report. That would take about four or five months. By that time we would have got some other state to agree to this, and then I would go out again. This went on regularly till about 1940, and then it was not so regular, but still there were quite a number of gaps left which we then gradually, one by one, covered.

**Interviewer:** Throughout your various trips over a decade, your base remained Bombay?

**Dr. Ali:** Between 1935 and 1940 I was in Dehra Dun, and I used to use that as my base. I would, after each survey, get back there. My wife died in 1939.

## The Baya Weaver Study

**Interviewer:** How did you come to find yourself at Kihim?

**Dr. Ali:** That was when I returned from Berlin and found that I had no job. Before we could decide on something to do, my wife's family had a little sort of villa in Kihim, so we went and stayed there because it was too expensive in Bombay and I had no income at that time.

It was there that I was lucky to be at the breeding season of the weaver birds. When I used to go around, I saw a place where there was a colony of birds building. That was a wonderful opportunity because we were there just at the beginning of the rains when the nesting season was commencing, and we stayed there till November. So it covered the entire nesting season of the weaver bird.

It's very seldom that you get such a long opportunity of watching a particular bird and its habits. Usually you have to put pieces together of little observations made now and again, but here I had a complete, connected, uninterrupted observation. Very lucky thing.

**Interviewer:** You were fairly close to Bombay then. Did you have the chance to compare your findings with what other people might have written on this?

**Dr. Ali:** Yes, quite a lot, because all the literature was there on it. But it was not very accurate because nobody had had a chance of watching the complete history of the thing. I was able to get quite a lot that was unknown before, and it has been tested again and again, not only here but on African weavers, and they found that it was quite true.

**Interviewer:** Subsequently, this study of yours on the baya weavers has turned out to be a turning point in your life in the sense that the world sort of took notice. All these calamities really—they start to pan out and they finally end up well, because if it hadn't been for this job being axed, I would never have thought of doing these surveys, which were really what made my work what it is. That was the opportunity to do it.

**Interviewer:** Coming back to your study on the bayas, did you have even the faintest inkling that this would turn out to be such a major piece of work?

**Dr. Ali:** I was actually more interested in photographing the birds, but I built a little hide in the middle of a small pond tank because it was the rainy season and that depression was full. Just above that tank was an overhanging babul tree which was full of weaver bird nests. So I built a platform about eight feet high and made a sort of hide on it with palm leaves. I sat in there to take photographs.

But very soon I discovered there were some wonderful things happening which had not been—I knew the literature of this bird, but I said these things have never been recorded. So then I left my camera aside and I watched steadily. Every day I would go and sit there a couple of hours and note down these observations.

**Interviewer:** What kind of wonderful things were these that fascinated you so much?

**Dr. Ali:** Well, for one thing, the literature said that male and female work together on the nest. I found that there were no females at all in that colony. There were about 30 or 40 nests, and all the nests were being built by males. I said, "How is that? Where are the females which are supposed to be helping?" It seems that it is only the males who build, and in the earlier stages there are no females at all.

Males go on building and singing and fluttering, and then one day suddenly a flock of females comes. They go from one nest to the other as if they were examining the structure of the nest. They enter the nest and the male tries to entice them. But if they don't approve the nest, they move on to the next nest and some other female comes and examines them.

Then finally, when one female approves a nest, they have the mating ceremony, and then she becomes his wife. She doesn't build the nest at all except for the interior decoration—she puts in a little feather here and there. Then she lays her eggs in it when the nest is half-finished. Then the male completes the nest while she sits inside, lays the eggs, and begins to incubate.

After completing the nest with the long tube, he begins to build a second nest nearby. When that nest is also half-completed, another batch of females comes looking for houses to rent. If one female approves of that, she takes possession of that, and the same history is repeated. Then the male goes on to build a third nest, and so on, till sometimes four and in rare cases even five nests a male builds. But for each one he has a female who lays eggs there and incubates and feeds the young.

**Interviewer:** Remarkable! This means what you discovered was that the nest-building technique for the baya would be of equal importance as, say, strength might be for a deer in terms of sexual selection?

**Dr. Ali:** Yes, this is entirely his thing. As long as his potency lasts, he goes on building. Later on, when it gets rather too late in the season, some males don't feed the young ordinarily, but when they're finished with the nest building, in the last nest sometimes the male helps the female to feed.

All these various little, small, seemingly insignificant observations lead up eventually to very meaningful reports in the books that you have published. They tell you so much about what may be happening in other species also, because then they open your eyes to the possibilities.

## Migration and Bird Ringing

**Interviewer:** Could you tell us how observations made by you in the field have led you to conclusions regarding the habits of birds? Migration, for instance—in your personal observations, have you been able to follow the track of species over the years in terms of their migratory patterns?

**Dr. Ali:** I was always very interested in this, but we were just talking in the air because we had not done any marking of birds. Unless you mark the birds, you know that birds come in the winter to a certain spot and then when the hot weather begins they go away, but we had no idea where particular birds came from or anything else about them. That is a thing that can be learned only if you mark the birds, because if a bird comes to a place and then goes away and comes again next year, you have no idea whether it's the same individual or some other because they all look absolutely alike.

But when you have marked them, then you can be quite sure. For instance, this wonderful thing happened at the place where I stayed at Kihim—I don't know if you have seen it, but we've got a little lawn which is just about the size of a badminton court. A yellow wagtail used to come there every year, and I was suspecting that it's the same bird, but you couldn't tell.

One day I had kept my car outside, and this bird came and started fighting with its image in the hubcap. So I put some horsehair nooses there and I caught the bird and I ringed it. You know that for the next five years it came—three years it came exactly on the 11th of September. That is my wife's birthday, so each time I looked out of the window, this bird was there on that day. But two years it got delayed—once it came on the 18th, once on the 20th.

So we knew, first of all, that it's the same bird, and secondly, we had no idea how long wagtails lived. So this was quite proof that it lives for at least five years. And when it first came, it had already been there a couple of years, so that's seven years.

This is how we gradually build up this knowledge about various things. We also know that the yellow wagtail nests in Kashmir, and that is about 1,500 miles from Bombay. So this bird has made so many trips—1,500 miles up and 1,500 miles down—and it arrived on the same lawn. How could it have found the way to Bombay first of all, then from Bombay came to Bandra, and from Bandra to that particular lawn, and on that particular day? That's really quite extraordinary and miraculous.

When you study migration, these are the sort of details that you come to find out which you cannot know in any other way except by marking the bird.

## Bird Songs and Calls

**Interviewer:** Tell us something about bird songs and bird calls. These seem to be the most obvious thing about birds—the sounds they make.

**Dr. Ali:** This is a very special study that has taken on within the last few years since the coming of the tape recorder. You record the sounds and you analyze them—the different wavelengths and so on. You find that they've also got a lot of dialects, just as they have slight differences in the subspecies—the northern and the southern. In the same way there are differences in the dialects also.

So people who have studied it carefully—they can even from the voice, by those sonographs they're called—if you analyze them you can see the components of the voice, and from that you can say fairly definitely what subspecies it would be.

**Interviewer:** Remarkable! This is how science and technology can be used for the enhancement of knowledge, particularly in the sphere of conservation and field observations. The songs of birds—usually it's the males who sing, and the songs are meant to attract the females at the nesting time. But more than that, they are a sort of advertisement to the female because usually these migrants—when they go back, it is usually the males that go first. They go first and they occupy a territory. From that territory they keep out other males—

# Interview with Dr. Salim Ali

## Bird Songs and Communication

**Q: What is the function of bird songs?**

A: The songs of birds are usually sung by males. They are meant to attract females at nesting time, but they serve more than that purpose. When males return from migration, they usually arrive first, occupy a territory, and keep out other males by fighting and making threatening postures. The song is not only an attraction for the female but also a warning to other males, telling them that this place is occupied. It's also an advertisement to a female looking for a nesting site—informing her that here is a desirable young man who is ready to receive her and has a house and territory.

**Q: What is the difference between bird songs and bird calls?**

A: Calls are usually just contact calls. For instance, when birds are flying at night, they emit a certain call to keep them together so they don't stray. They also have danger signals, which are usually understood not only by the same species but by many other species as well. When birds see an owl or something similar, the bird that sees it makes a warning call and all the other birds gather around. It's like a predator alarm system.

## Conservation and Agriculture

**Q: How do birds impact agriculture and forestry?**

A: Birds have a very strong impact on agriculture and forestry, particularly the insect-eating birds and birds like owls which eat rats and mice—great pests of agriculture. Some birds are seen to eat grain in the field and are considered destructive to crops. The baya weaver eats a lot of grain and does damage to crops. But when the young are in the nest, they have to be fed entirely on soft-bodied insects. So the bird is harmful half its life and beneficial half its life. Unless you study the whole life history, you wouldn't know this. You would only see the bird doing damage and think you should get rid of it.

**Q: Can you give an example of what happens when birds are eliminated?**

A: This happened in China with sparrows. But this is not a new lesson—in France in the last century, they destroyed all the birds and then found that crops were suffering so much that they had to introduce them again.

## Mating Systems in Birds

**Q: Can you explain the different mating systems in birds?**

A: There is a vast range of mating systems. The crane is very much revered because it is supposed to be monogamous. The couple is supposed to be so devoted that if one dies, the other supposedly finds a way. But this belief is a bit extreme. If the mate is killed, the bird is lonely for a time but then it soon gets used to it and acquires another mate.

The baya weaver practices successive polygyny—where each male has several females in succession. Then there's the opposite: the painted snipe and the bustard quail, where the male has to do all the work. The female goes about looking for males, gets them to incubate eggs and bring up chicks, while she goes around looking for another male.

Another system is the lek system, like the ruffian reeve. Males collect on an open ground and have mock fights. Females come in turns and have different colors—some are white, some purplish, some variegated. The female exercises her choice, mates with a male, and then goes away. The male has nothing more to do with her. Then the next female comes.

There's also a resource-based polygamy, found in honey guides. One male takes possession of a number of combs, making them his territory. When females come ready to breed, he mates with them and allows them to eat wax from his territory. This is a system of reward and incentive.

## Intelligence vs. Instinct in Birds

**Q: How do you distinguish between intelligence and instinct in birds?**

A: Most of the actions and behavior of birds have instinct as the basis—inherited instinct. For instance, migration is purely an inherited instinct. If you take eggs from a weaver bird nest, hatch them in an incubator, and rear the young by hand, when nesting time comes and you give them proper material, they will build exactly the same complicated woven nest as their parents did—even though they've never seen their parents or nests. This is the basis for most of their behavior.

However, there are cases you cannot account for with instinct alone. I once saw a crow that had caught a rat. The rat was squealing, so the crow sat in the middle of a stream and dipped the rat in the water and kept it there for some time. When he took it out, the rat was still squeaking, so he put it back again. The crow wasn't doing this every day or from learned experience. In this case, I would say it was certainly intelligence—what is known as reasoning. The crow worked out that if he did this, something would happen.

## Conservation and Human Priorities

**Q: How do we communicate the necessity to save birds and animals to the common person?**

A: People have a misconceived notion that conservationists are trying to save animals and birds while ignoring human strife. We need to communicate that saving animals and birds is corollary to saving human beings. Human beings are not in a position to look after their own land. Birds, animals, and other microflora are necessary to the well-being of the land.

If there is more literacy and proper use of radio and television, it would help. In India, where we have so many different languages, these are the only ways of getting at people and telling them what we are doing. It's a pity that not more attention is being paid to this.

**Q: Is it ever justified to protect birds at the cost of humans?**

A: This is a completely mistaken idea. When lives were lost at Bharatpur in 1983, it had nothing to do with the birds. It was because of vested interests and political interests who wanted to work up agitation. Trouble like that need not happen because of birds—it could happen anywhere. I don't know why birds have been blamed for human lives lost.

## Status of Ornithology in India

**Q: Is Indian ornithology lagging behind international standards?**

A: We are far behind. We are just waking up really. There has been no importance attached to ornithology. We have tried to persuade the government to take up at least economic ornithology, which has direct bearing on human life, but it has been very difficult. I have been trying since 1935 and nothing seems to have happened.

One chief reason was that there were no jobs to be had in ornithology. If we had established ornithology projects earlier, we could have produced scientists and caught up with what is being done outside. But we got no encouragement.

Most of our ornithological work has been done by amateurs and amateur institutes like the Bombay Natural History Society. The amount of work that has been done is creditable, considering the discouragements and difficulties we've faced.

**Q: What role can amateurs continue to play in conservation?**

A: Amateurs can do quite a lot, but they must have real interest and dedication. Nowadays research has reached such a high standard that an amateur who only has a diligent interest in spare time cannot make useful contributions. It wants dedication and perseverance. If an amateur can devote that dedication, they can do far better work because they're not compelled to do it to earn their living.

## Endangered Species

**Q: What hope do you hold out for endangered birds like the Siberian crane?**

A: We are doing everything possible. If every country through which these birds migrate would take that much trouble, there's every hope the bird can be saved. The trouble is that during migration, these birds have to go through countries like Afghanistan where people are not at all aware of conservation. They only look at the birds as so many kilograms of meat.

**Q: What about the black-necked crane and the great Indian bustard?**

A: These are also severely endangered. The Bombay Natural History Society has an endangered species project doing excellent work studying the great Indian bustard. We find they can easily be preserved with a little care. Of course, protection is needed—human beings are the worst predators you can imagine. They stand in more danger from humans than from any other source.

For the black-necked crane, there is no population pressure on its habitat, but the trouble is that shepherds and people go to the areas where the birds breed because that is where the grazing is best. Shepherd boys find eggs and pick them.

Fortunately, in Ladakh and similar places, army personnel have been given direct instructions to protect these nests and have taken a very enlightened stand. The army are the only people who can police these areas effectively.

## Ornithological Research Gaps

**Q: What areas of ornithological work have not been covered in India?**

A: As far as the inventory of birds goes, I think we have done it completely. It's very unlikely that a new bird species will be found. Apart from that, we have done nothing at all. We know nothing about the life histories of these birds.

Museum work—classifying and so on—has been done not only in India but all over the world. But we have opportunities for studying life histories for which we don't find enough people.

The eastern ghats is one area much nearer home about which we know nothing. It's just like the western ghats but in many ways much more untouched by human activity. It's a wonderful place for research and study.

## The Bird Hazard Project

**Q: What is the bird hazard project?**

A: The Bombay Natural History Society is engaged in quite an ambitious project dealing with bird strikes on aircraft. The idea is to discover ways and means to reduce the incidence of bird strikes. It's of tremendous economic importance to the air force and civil aviation authorities.

We have been able to do very good work determining which birds are involved and why they gather around airports. Most of the offenders in northern India particularly are vultures. To keep vultures off, we need to keep the precincts of the airport clean by having modern abattoirs where no refuse is thrown out. This will prevent birds from haunting those areas.

However, it takes such a long time to implement recommendations. Municipalities are responsible but always have no money for making changes. Unless these recommendations are implemented, we cannot say whether they will be successful.

## Influences and Mentors

**Q: Who were the key influences on your development as an ornithologist?**

A: My great advantage was beginning at the Bombay Natural History Society with Mr. Millard, who was the honorary secretary. When I was about eight or nine years old, I took a sparrow to him for identification. He was so taken aback at an Indian boy being so interested in birds that he took special trouble. He suggested I make a small collection and brought me books.

Later, I was closely connected with my friend Prater, who was assistant curator. We did a lot of birding around Bombay.

My real scientific ornithology started when I went to Germany for a special course in systematic ornithology under Professor Ernst Stresemann, who was absolutely the giant of the world of ornithology at the time. Through him, I learned about ecology—how birds live, the habitats, and what different factors in the habitat attract certain species. This became my own interest in bird study.

**Q: Who else influenced your work?**

A: Oscar Heinroth was the father of ethology—bird behavior and ecology. He and his wife collected eggs of all birds found in Europe, hatched them artificially, and studied their life, behavior, food, and molts from hatchling to adult. They photographed the birds at every stage and produced four beautiful volumes that really form the basis of bird behavior study.

Hugh Whistler was a policeman in India who made very good studies of the birds of Punjab. I didn't go on expeditions with him, but when I got specimens, I kept the ecological and field notes, and he did the taxonomical work on the skins I sent him.

**Q: What about S. Dillon Ripley?**

A: I came to know him during the war when he was just graduated from Yale. He was sent to Sri Lanka and would stop in Bombay. We discussed various things and our plans. We have worked together a lot, with our interest being to find out how bird life is changing with changing environment. We have repeated our visits to certain areas after so many years and compared conditions.

His strong point is taxonomy and mine is not really interested in taxonomy. We divided up the work—he did the taxonomical part and I did the field and ecological part. This gave us a smooth-running combination. He got me a fellowship at Yale so we could coordinate our work together.

**Q: Who were some other important associates?**

A: Humayun Abdulali was under my influence when he was a college student. He used to spend his holidays with me in camp in Travancore and Hyderabad. He admits that's where he picked up the tricks of the trade.

Dr. Biswamoy Biswas from the Zoological Survey of India did really good work more or less without much encouragement from above, but he's become one of our best systematic ornithologists.

J.C. Hopwood was in the Imperial Forest Service in Davoi, Burma, where I was a nester. I was a greenhorn at the time just beginning my bird study career. Hopwood was a very keen bird student and he was collecting birds and eggs for Stewart Baker's Fauna of British India series. He was very cooperative and helpful to me at that time.

Colonel Meinertzhagen and I had adventures in Afghanistan during bird migration. He had made a special study of the effect of light on desert coloration of animals. We both had the same interest in how the coloration of birds resembles the soil color on which they live.

**Q: What about Peter Scott?**

A: I have been very friendly with Peter Scott since 1950 when we've been at various ornithological congresses together. He's an expert on waterfowl. When he came to Bharatpur, he took so much interest and gave many suggestions for improvement. His saying that he has not seen as good a waterfowl sanctuary anywhere in the world means something because he has seen most of the important ones.

**Q: Who was Dr. David Lack?**

A: He was a great friend of mine and a very high-class ornithologist. He and his wife made a special study of the swift living in a tower in Oxford, 100 feet high. They would go up and down every day and sit there for hours watching it. He wrote a very good book called "Swifts in a Tower." When I visited Oxford, I asked to see these nests. He tried to dissuade me because of the height, but I was boastful and said I'm used to that kind of thing in India. It was a straight ladder with no railings, and when I looked down about 50 feet, my heart sank. But I had boasted so much that I had to get my teeth and do it.

Dr. Lack was the outside examiner for my first doctoral student, which gave me confidence that we were on the right lines.

## Modern Technology in Ornithology

**Q: How do you view the increasing use of technology in ornithology—radar tracking, satellite tracking, computerization?**

A: I have not had personal contacts with this work. The general trend I find nowadays is too mathematical and too mechanical so that one loses the interest in the bird itself. You get very clever mathematical solutions to various things, but I'm afraid that sort of ornithology is too modern for us who have grown up in the old tradition.

There are now so many projects that can be solved without interference of birds at all. You can get quantitative data on certain aspects of bird life without much study of the bird itself. That type of ornithology is too advanced for us old-style workers who are interested really in the living bird in its natural habitat. I don't try very hard to keep up now, but I have enjoyed my work with living birds.

## Young Ornithologists and Future of Conservation

**Q: What about the young ornithologists working in India today?**

A: We have got a lot of very promising material. The few young men working with the Bombay Natural History Society in our various projects are absolutely first-class people. Not only do we think so in India, but we have sent them to various international conferences and have got very flattering reports. It is only opportunity that is wanted. There's no reason why our young people should not be as proficient in ornithology as anywhere else, provided they have the opportunity.

Mr. Zafar Futeh, who is now in Bangalore, is also one of my trainees. Though he is not a scientist, he is very much interested in birds. It is creditable to him that he has kept up the bird watchers newsletter which he started about 20 years ago. It's still going on quite well and has created a lot of interest among lay amateur bird watchers.

## Meeting with Political and Historical Figures

**Q: What was your meeting with Gandhi like?**

A: The greatest thrill I got in meeting one of these great people is when I met Gandhiji. This was about 1915 when he had just returned from Africa. My brother was in the Indian Civil Service and was a collector in Gujarat. Gandhi was called as a witness in a sedition case. After the court got up, my brother brought him to the tent for tea. It was the only time I could have a sort of date with him. I found him an extraordinarily wonderful man because he had a fine sense of humor, which is very much lacking in most politicians. He was one of those who had the real British character of being able to laugh at themselves, which is a very rare thing.

**Q: What about Jawaharlal Nehru?**

A: I used to live in Dehradun when he was imprisoned in Dehradun jail. My landlord was the jail superintendent who used to bring me messages from Nehru saying he would like to have a chat on birds. I used to go and spend time with him and talk about birds. He requested a copy of the book of Indian birds because he wanted to present it to his daughter and wanted my autograph. Mrs. Gandhi still has that book and says she got her first interest in birds from this book. That's remarkable.

**Q: Did you meet Morarji Desai?**

A: When Morarji Desai was Prime Minister, I saw him and told him about our work. He said the progress we've been making is like preaching to people already converted. He asked what we've done for the people actually suffering from wildlife ravages. He said we have cinema shows and lectures to people in cities who already know about conservation, but have you explained to a villager or forest dweller why they should preserve wildlife?

He posed a scenario: if a villager's cow—his sole worldly possession that feeds his children on milk—is killed by a tiger, how do you convince him that there's a point in preserving the tiger? He said unless such people are convinced and on your side, you will never be able to save wildlife. This was a very wise thing to say.

His point was that we talk in cities to people who already know the problem, but we haven't really tried to explain to ordinary people. To explain to them is really very difficult because they won't be prepared to listen to me. It's only somebody whom they respect in their own village, who talks their language and in the idioms they're used to—somebody whose advice they're prepared to follow. This is really the work of panchayat people and those in legislative councils in their constituency, but they're so busy with political wranglings that this gets passed by. 
It's most unfortunate because the truth is that conservation and social reform are two
sides of the same coin particularly in a country like ours in india. It's evident to anybody who wishes to
see that our people are as directly dependent on the land as the animals and birds are. 

*So this perhaps is one of the major contributions you've made because I think following your example there have been a host of a tribe of people who've gone out to understood the concepts and
somewhat like a multiplier effect have communicated their understanding to others*

Yes, thank you
